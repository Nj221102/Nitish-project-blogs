## 🚀 Welcome to Summer of Bitcoin 2025!

I'm thrilled to announce my participation in **Summer of Bitcoin 2025** (SOB25), where I'll be building a revolutionary non-custodial payment infrastructure for [Shopstr](https://shopstr.store) - the future of decentralized e-commerce.

---

## 🎯 Project Vision

**Mission:** Transform how people transact online by creating a seamless Bitcoin Lightning payment experience that doesn't compromise on the core principles of cryptocurrency - user sovereignty and financial freedom.

**Platform:** Shopstr - A decentralized marketplace where Bitcoin is a first-class citizen, not an afterthought.

## 🏗️ What I'm Building

### Core Architecture Components

**🌐 DNS Management API**
- BIP-353 compliant username system (`user@domain`)
- Automated DNSSEC deployment
- Zero-downtime DNS propagation
- **Status:** ✅ 100% Complete

**⚡ Lightning Payment Core**
- Greenlight node integration
- Non-custodial architecture (users control their keys)
- Real-time payment processing
- **Status:** 🚧 70% Complete

**🔄 State Management**
- WebSocket notifications
- Redis-based caching with Pub/Sub
- Distributed transaction handling
- **Status:** 🚧 60% Complete

### Technical Stack

```
Frontend (Next.js) ←→ Backend (Go) ←→ Lightning (Greenlight)
                         ↕
                   DNS API (BIP-353)
```

**Languages & Frameworks:**
- **Backend:** Go (performance + type safety)
- **Frontend:** Next.js (modern React experience)
- **Database:** Redis (real-time caching)
- **Payments:** Bitcoin Lightning Network

## 🌟 Why This Matters

### The Problem
Current e-commerce payment solutions are:
- **Custodial** - platforms control your money
- **Centralized** - single points of failure
- **Expensive** - high fees eat into merchant profits
- **Slow** - settlement takes days

### The Solution
Our Bitcoin Lightning integration provides:
- **✅ Instant Payments** - Lightning-fast transactions
- **✅ Low Fees** - Fraction of traditional payment costs  
- **✅ Global Access** - No geographic restrictions
- **✅ User Sovereignty** - You control your Bitcoin
- **✅ Privacy** - No unnecessary data collection
