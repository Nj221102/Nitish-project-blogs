## Project Scope and Objectives

This document outlines the technical development of a non-custodial Bitcoin Lightning Network payment infrastructure for the Shopstr marketplace platform as part of Summer of Bitcoin 2025 (SOB25).

**Primary Objective:** Implement a production-grade payment system that maintains Bitcoin's core principles of user sovereignty while providing practical e-commerce functionality.

**Target Platform:** [Shopstr](https://shopstr.store) - Decentralized marketplace infrastructure

## Problem Statement and Solution Architecture

### Current E-commerce Payment Limitations

Contemporary payment processing systems exhibit several architectural deficiencies:

- **Custodial Control:** Third-party custody requirements violate user sovereignty principles
- **Centralized Infrastructure:** Single points of failure compromise system reliability
- **Settlement Latency:** Multi-day settlement periods impact cash flow
- **Transaction Costs:** High processing fees reduce merchant margins
- **Geographic Restrictions:** Legacy banking limitations restrict global commerce

### Proposed Technical Solution

The Lightning Network payment integration addresses these limitations through:

**Instant Settlement:** Sub-second transaction finality via Lightning Network routing
**Reduced Fees:** Minimal routing costs (typically <1% of transaction value)
**Global Accessibility:** Borderless transactions without traditional banking dependencies
**User Sovereignty:** Private key control remains with end users
**Privacy Preservation:** Onion routing provides transaction path privacy
