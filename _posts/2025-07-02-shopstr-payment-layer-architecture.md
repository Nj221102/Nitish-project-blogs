## Phase 1 Completion: DNS Infrastructure

### Technical Implementation Details

**Framework Stack:**
- **Backend:** TypeScript with Express.js framework
- **Queue System:** Redis-based job queueing with Bull queue
- **DNS Provider:** Cloudflare DNS API integration
- **Database:** Redis for caching and status tracking
- **Security:** DNSSEC automatic enforcement, rate limiting
- **Validation:** Comprehensive input sanitization with Joi schemas

### Core API Implementation

**DNS Record Management Architecture**
The system implements a comprehensive TypeScript-based DNS registration interface that accepts username, domain, BOLT12 offer, and DNSSEC configuration parameters. Input validation uses structured Joi schemas to ensure data integrity and prevent malicious inputs. The API follows RESTful principles with appropriate HTTP status codes and detailed error messaging.

**Asynchronous Job Processing**
Rather than blocking client requests during DNS operations, the system immediately queues registration tasks in Redis with unique job identifiers. Each job includes configurable retry attempts with exponential backoff delays, automatic cleanup policies, and comprehensive progress tracking. The queue architecture supports distributed processing across multiple worker instances for enhanced scalability.

**Status Monitoring Endpoint**
A dedicated status checking interface provides real-time visibility into job processing states, progress percentages, completion timestamps, and detailed result metadata. The system maintains job status persistence in Redis with configurable time-to-live values, enabling reliable status retrieval even during system restarts or worker failures.

### Queue Processing Implementation

**DNS Job Worker Architecture**
The background processing system implements a sophisticated multi-stage workflow for DNS record creation, global propagation verification, and DNSSEC signing. Each job progresses through defined stages with incremental progress updates, comprehensive error handling, and automatic rollback capabilities for failed operations.

**DNS Record Creation Process**
The worker begins by creating Cloudflare DNS TXT records with BIP-353 compliant content formatting, including proper bitcoin URI scheme implementation and BOLT 12 offer encoding. The system includes detailed logging and comment metadata for operational tracking and debugging purposes.

**Global Propagation Verification**
The system implements intelligent DNS propagation checking across multiple global resolvers including Cloudflare, Google, and Quad9. The verification process requires consensus from at least eighty percent of configured resolvers before proceeding to DNSSEC signing, ensuring reliable global accessibility.

**DNSSEC Integration and Caching**
Upon successful propagation verification, the system triggers automated DNSSEC signing processes and updates Redis cache with record metadata, DNS record identifiers, creation timestamps, and DNSSEC status. The caching layer includes configurable time-to-live values and automatic cache invalidation for record updates.

**Error Handling and Recovery**
Comprehensive error handling includes structured logging with correlation identifiers, automatic retry mechanisms with exponential backoff, and graceful failure modes with detailed error reporting. The system maintains job status persistence throughout the entire lifecycle, enabling reliable operation monitoring and debugging.

## Phase 2 Progress: Greenlight Backend Development

### Current Implementation Status: 70% Complete

**Framework Selection:** Python with FastAPI for asynchronous operation support and automatic API documentation generation.

### Completed Components

**1. Node Registration System**
The node registration endpoint processes BIP-39 seed phrases to generate Lightning node credentials through Greenlight integration.

Error handling includes comprehensive exception management with appropriate HTTP status codes and detailed error responses for debugging purposes.

**2. BOLT 12 Offer Generation**
The username registration system generates BOLT 12 offers through Greenlight client integration with customizable amount specifications and descriptive metadata. The process includes automatic DNS backend communication for TXT record creation and comprehensive status tracking for both offer generation and DNS registration completion.

## Integration Workflow Implementation

### DNS-Greenlight Integration Process

**Multi-Service Architecture Workflow**
