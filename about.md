## 🎓 Academic Project Information

**Student:** Nitish Jha  
**Institution:** Polaris School of Technology (Starex University)  
**Program:** B.Tech Computer Science  
**Academic Level:** 2nd Year (2nd Semester)  
**Project Duration:** May 15 - August 15, 2025  

## 📋 Project Synopsis

This Summer of Bitcoin 2025 project creates a **non-custodial payment alternative** to Shopstr's current Cashu payment system. The implementation allows users to utilize Greenlight nodes for creating BOLT 12 offers linked to BIP-353 usernames like `user@shopstr.store`, enabling direct payment reception without custodial intermediaries.

### Technical Objectives

**Primary Goal:** Implement production-grade Lightning Network payment infrastructure that preserves Bitcoin's non-custodial principles while providing enterprise-level reliability and user experience.

**Target Integration:** [Shopstr](https://shopstr.store) marketplace platform

### Current Implementation Status

**🔧 Technical Architecture:**
- **DNS Backend:** Node.js with Express.js framework (✅ Complete)
- **Greenlight Backend:** Python with FastAPI (🚧 70% Complete)  
- **Frontend UI:** Next.js integration with Shopstr (📋 Planned)
- **Security Framework:** Non-custodial key management with AES-256 encryption

**📊 Development Progress:**
- ✅ **DNS Management Infrastructure** - Production deployment ready
- 🚧 **Greenlight Backend Services** - Node registration and BOLT 12 generation complete  
- 📋 **Frontend Authentication Gateway** - Next development phase (July 10-23)
- � **Wallet Dashboard Implementation** - Scheduled for weeks 11-12
- 🔐 **Final Integration and Testing** - August 7-15

### 🛠️ Key Innovations

**Non-Custodial Design**
- User seed phrases never stored
- Complete user control over funds
- Zero-trust architecture

**Seamless UX**
- Human-readable payment addresses (`user@domain`)
- Real-time payment notifications via WebSockets
- Automatic DNS propagation handling

**Enterprise-Grade Infrastructure**
- Redis Pub/Sub for state management
- Idempotent DNSSEC deployment
- Kubernetes-ready microservices
