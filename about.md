## 🚀 Summer of Bitcoin 2025

I'm **Nitish Jha**, a SOB25 participant working on revolutionizing e-commerce payments through Bitcoin Lightning Network integration with Shopstr.

### Technical Objectives

**Primary Goal:** Implement production-grade Lightning Network payment infrastructure that preserves Bitcoin's non-custodial principles while providing enterprise-level reliability and user experience.

**Target Integration:** [Shopstr](https://shopstr.store) marketplace platform

### Current Implementation Status

**🔧 Technical Architecture:**
- **Backend Services:** Go microservices with gRPC communication
- **Lightning Integration:** Greenlight node management and BOLT protocol compliance  
- **DNS Infrastructure:** BIP-353 compliant username system with DNSSEC automation
- **Security Framework:** Non-custodial key management with in-memory processing

**📊 Development Progress:**
- ✅ **DNS Management Infrastructure** - Production deployment ready
- 🚧 **Lightning Payment Core** - 70% implementation complete  
- 🚧 **Real-time State Management** - WebSocket and Redis Pub/Sub integration
- 📋 **Frontend Integration** - Next development phase
- 🔐 **Security Audit** - Scheduled for completion phase

### 🛠️ Key Innovations

**Non-Custodial Design**
- User seed phrases never stored
- Complete user control over funds
- Zero-trust architecture

**Seamless UX**
- Human-readable payment addresses (`user@domain`)
- Real-time payment notifications via WebSockets
- Automatic DNS propagation handling

**Enterprise-Grade Infrastructure**
- Redis Pub/Sub for state management
- Idempotent DNSSEC deployment
- Kubernetes-ready microservices
