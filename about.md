## 🚀 Summer of Bitcoin 2025

I'm **Nitish Jha**, a SOB25 participant working on revolutionizing e-commerce payments through Bitcoin Lightning Network integration with Shopstr.

### � Project Overview

**Mission:** Build a non-custodial Bitcoin Lightning payment layer that enables seamless cryptocurrency transactions while maintaining user sovereignty over their funds.

**Platform:** [Shopstr](https://shopstr.store) - The decentralized marketplace of the future

### 🎯 Current Focus: Payment Architecture

**🔧 Technical Stack:**
- **Backend:** Go (Golang) for high-performance APIs
- **Lightning:** Greenlight nodes for Bitcoin payments  
- **DNS:** BIP-353 compliant username system
- **Security:** Non-custodial architecture ensuring user fund control

**📊 Progress Tracker:**
- ✅ **DNS Management API** - 100% Complete
- 🚧 **Greenlight Core Services** - 70% Complete  
- 📋 **Frontend Integration** - Next Phase
- 🔐 **Security Audit** - Planned

### 🛠️ Key Innovations

**Non-Custodial Design**
- User seed phrases never stored
- Complete user control over funds
- Zero-trust architecture

**Seamless UX**
- Human-readable payment addresses (`user@domain`)
- Real-time payment notifications via WebSockets
- Automatic DNS propagation handling

**Enterprise-Grade Infrastructure**
- Redis Pub/Sub for state management
- Idempotent DNSSEC deployment
- Kubernetes-ready microservices
